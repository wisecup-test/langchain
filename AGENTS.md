# Project ADRs

This project's conventions are encoded as ADRs under `.actual/rules/`. **The ADRs ARE the pattern.** Follow them verbatim instead of reading existing implementations to figure out how to do something.

> **Note:** this directive is calibrated for one-shot tasks (a single discrete feature). For multi-task interactive sessions, consult the ADRs for each task transition rather than holding to the per-session caps below.

## Workflow (follow in order)

1. **Identify topic.** Match the files you'll edit against the path-glob table below. Pick the 1-3 topics that match. Do not pre-emptively pick "related" topics; pick only what the file paths actually match.

2. **Read ADRs you'll actually apply.** For each chosen topic, run `ls .actual/rules/<topic>-*.md`. Each filename has three parts: `<topic>-<aspect-slug>-<hash>.md`. The `<aspect-slug>` (middle segment) is the ADR's specific concern — e.g., `database-schema-defined`, `zod-input-validation`, `cache-key-format`.

   **Scan all filenames first**, then identify which aspect-slugs match what you're about to write. Read at most **3 ADR files per topic** whose aspect-slugs directly apply. **Do not read more than 5 ADR files total** across all topics. Broadly-scoped topics like `cross-cutting-` may contain 50+ rules; most won't apply to your task. Filter by aspect-slug *before* reading content.

3. **Locate insertion points (one read per file, max 3 files).** You may read source files ONLY to (a) find where to add code (which directory, which barrel export to update) or (b) look up an exact identifier you must import. **Do not read source files as pattern examples — the ADRs already encode the pattern.** If you find yourself reading a file because "I want to see how X is done elsewhere," stop. The ADR you already read tells you how.

4. **Implement.** Write the code following the rule statements verbatim. If two ADRs seem to conflict, follow the more specific one (longer topic prefix wins).

5. **Verify after implementing.** Only after the code is written, re-read the `verify_commands` or `accept_criteria` sections of the ADRs you applied and check your work against them. Run the verify commands if any.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Reading the first N rules alphabetically because they're cheap. Filter by aspect-slug first, then read only the relevant ones.
- Reading >5 ADR files for a single feature. If you're tempted, you're over-scoping the topic match.
- Reading existing similar features to "see the pattern" — the ADRs encode the pattern. Trust them.
- Re-reading the same ADR multiple times. Cache it mentally.
- Continuing to browse the codebase after step 3. By step 4 you should be writing, not reading.

Each rule file at `.actual/rules/<topic>-<aspect>-<hash>.md` contains the full ADR with rule statements, verify commands, and accept criteria.

## Verification Protocol

These rules are ALWAYS ACTIVE. Apply every rule that governs the files you touch to all code generation, modification, and review — no exceptions unless a rule says otherwise.

Every rule follows a **Verify → Fix → Repeat** loop. After generating or modifying code for any rule you MUST:

1. **RUN** the rule's `### Verify` command(s).
2. **CAPTURE** the full output (stdout + stderr).
3. **EVALUATE** the output against the rule's **Accept when** criteria.
4. **IF FAILING:** diagnose the root cause, apply a fix, and re-run from step 1.
5. **IF PASSING:** keep the passing output as evidence before moving on.
6. **MAX ITERATIONS:** 5 attempts per rule. If still failing after 5 attempts, STOP and report the failure with all captured output.

Compliance is not optional. Do not skip verification, assume correctness, or defer it to a later task. Every change to a governed area must be accompanied by a passing verification run.

## Path glob → topic

# Global development guidelines for the LangChain monorepo

This document provides context to understand the LangChain Python project and assist with development.

## Project architecture and context

### Monorepo structure

This is a Python monorepo with multiple independently versioned packages that use `uv`.

```txt
langchain/
├── libs/
│   ├── core/             # `langchain-core` primitives and base abstractions
│   ├── langchain/        # `langchain-classic` (legacy, no new features)
│   ├── langchain_v1/     # Actively maintained `langchain` package
│   ├── partners/         # Third-party integrations
│   │   ├── openai/       # OpenAI models and embeddings
│   │   ├── anthropic/    # Anthropic (Claude) integration
│   │   ├── ollama/       # Local model support
│   │   └── ... (other integrations maintained by the LangChain team)
│   ├── text-splitters/   # Document chunking utilities
│   ├── standard-tests/   # Shared test suite for integrations
│   ├── model-profiles/   # Model configuration profiles
├── .github/              # CI/CD workflows and templates
├── .vscode/              # VSCode IDE standard settings and recommended extensions
└── README.md             # Information about LangChain
```

- **Core layer** (`langchain-core`): Base abstractions, interfaces, and protocols. Users should not need to know about this layer directly.
- **Implementation layer** (`langchain`): Concrete implementations and high-level public utilities
- **Integration layer** (`partners/`): Third-party service integrations. Note that this monorepo is not exhaustive of all LangChain integrations; some are maintained in separate repos, such as `langchain-ai/langchain-google` and `langchain-ai/langchain-aws`. Usually these repos are cloned at the same level as this monorepo, so if needed, you can refer to their code directly by navigating to `../langchain-google/` from this monorepo.
- **Testing layer** (`standard-tests/`): Standardized integration tests for partner integrations

### Development tools & commands

- `uv` – Fast Python package installer and resolver (replaces pip/poetry)
- `make` – Task runner for common development commands. Feel free to look at the `Makefile` for available commands and usage patterns.
- `ruff` – Fast Python linter and formatter
- `mypy` – Static type checking
- `pytest` – Testing framework

This monorepo uses `uv` for dependency management. Local development uses editable installs: `[tool.uv.sources]`

Each package in `libs/` has its own `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

Before running your tests, set up all packages by running:

```bash
# For all groups
uv sync --all-groups

# or, to install a specific group only:
uv sync --group test
```

```bash
# Run unit tests (no network)
make test

# Run specific test file
uv run --group test pytest tests/unit_tests/test_specific.py
```

```bash
# Lint code
make lint

# Format code
make format

# Type checking
uv run --group lint mypy .
```

#### Key config files

- pyproject.toml: Main workspace configuration with dependency groups
- uv.lock: Locked dependencies for reproducible builds
- Makefile: Development tasks

#### PR and commit titles

Follow Conventional Commits. See `.github/workflows/pr_lint.yml` for allowed types and scopes. All titles must include a scope with no exceptions — even for the main `langchain` package.

- Start the text after `type(scope):` with a lowercase letter, unless the first word is a proper noun (e.g. `Azure`, `GitHub`, `OpenAI`) or a named entity (class, function, method, parameter, or variable name).
- Wrap named entities in backticks so they render as code. Proper nouns are left unadorned.
- Keep titles short and descriptive — save detail for the body.

Examples:

```txt
feat(langchain): add new chat completion feature
fix(core): resolve type hinting issue in vector store
chore(anthropic): update infrastructure dependencies
feat(langchain): `ls_agent_type` tag on `create_agent` calls
fix(openai): infer Azure chat profiles from model name
```

#### PR descriptions

The description *is* the summary — do not add a `# Summary` header.

- When the PR closes an issue, lead with the closing keyword on its own line at the very top, followed by a horizontal rule and then the body:

  ```txt
  Closes #123

  ---

  <rest of description>
  ```

  Only `Closes`, `Fixes`, and `Resolves` auto-close the referenced issue on merge. `Related:` or similar labels are informational and do not close anything.

- Explain the *why*: the motivation and why this solution is the right one. Limit prose.
- Write for readers who may be unfamiliar with this area of the codebase. Avoid insider shorthand and prefer language that is friendly to public viewers — this aids interpretability.
- Do **not** cite line numbers; they go stale as soon as the file changes.
- Rarely include full file paths or filenames. Reference the affected symbol, class, or subsystem by name instead.
- Wrap class, function, method, parameter, and variable names in backticks.
- Skip dedicated "Test plan" or "Testing" sections in most cases. Mention tests only when coverage is non-obvious, risky, or otherwise notable.
- Call out areas of the change that require careful review.
- Add a brief disclaimer noting AI-agent involvement in the contribution.

## Core development principles

### Maintain stable public interfaces

CRITICAL: Always attempt to preserve function signatures, argument positions, and names for exported/public methods. Do not make breaking changes.
You should warn the developer for any function signature changes, regardless of whether they look breaking or not.

**Before making ANY changes to public APIs:**

- Check if the function/class is exported in `__init__.py`
- Look for existing usage patterns in tests and examples
- Use keyword-only arguments for new parameters: `*, new_param: str = "default"`
- Mark experimental features clearly with docstring warnings (using MkDocs Material admonitions, like `!!! warning`)

Ask: "Would this change break someone's code if they used it last week?"

### Code quality standards

All Python code MUST include type hints and return types.

```python title="Example"
def filter_unknown_users(users: list[str], known_users: set[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Single line description of the function.

    Any additional context about the function can go here.

    Args:
        users: List of user identifiers to filter.
        known_users: Set of known/valid user identifiers.

    Returns:
        List of users that are not in the `known_users` set.
    """
```

- Use descriptive, self-explanatory variable names.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase you're modifying
- Attempt to break up complex functions (>20 lines) into smaller, focused functions where it makes sense

### Testing requirements

Every new feature or bugfix MUST be covered by unit tests.

- Unit tests: `tests/unit_tests/` (no network calls allowed)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration_tests/` (network calls permitted)
- We use `pytest` as the testing framework; if in doubt, check other existing tests for examples.
- The testing file structure should mirror the source code structure.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Tests fail when your new logic is broken
- [ ] Happy path is covered
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are tested
- [ ] Use fixtures/mocks for external dependencies
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Does the test suite fail if your new logic is broken?

### Security and risk assessment

- No `eval()`, `exec()`, or `pickle` on user-controlled input
- Proper exception handling (no bare `except:`) and use a `msg` variable for error messages
- Remove unreachable/commented code before committing
- Race conditions or resource leaks (file handles, sockets, threads).
- Ensure proper resource cleanup (file handles, connections)

### Documentation standards

Use Google-style docstrings with Args section for all public functions.

```python title="Example"
def send_email(to: str, msg: str, *, priority: str = "normal") -> bool:
    """Send an email to a recipient with specified priority.

    Any additional context about the function can go here.

    Args:
        to: The email address of the recipient.
        msg: The message body to send.
        priority: Email priority level.

    Returns:
        `True` if email was sent successfully, `False` otherwise.

    Raises:
        InvalidEmailError: If the email address format is invalid.
        SMTPConnectionError: If unable to connect to email server.
    """
```

- Types go in function signatures, NOT in docstrings
  - If a default is present, DO NOT repeat it in the docstring unless there is post-processing or it is set conditionally.
- Focus on "why" rather than "what" in descriptions
- Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Keep descriptions concise but clear
- Ensure American English spelling (e.g., "behavior", not "behaviour")
- Do NOT use Sphinx-style double backtick formatting (` ``code`` `). Use single backticks (`` `code` ``) for inline code references in docstrings and comments.

#### Model references in docs and examples

Always use the latest generally available (GA) models when referencing LLMs in docstrings and illustrative code snippets. Avoid preview or beta identifiers unless the model has no GA equivalent. Outdated model names signal stale code and confuse users.

Before writing or updating model references, verify current model IDs against the provider's official docs. Do not rely on memorized or cached model names — they go stale quickly.

Changing **shipped default parameter values** in code (e.g., a `model=` kwarg default in a class constructor) may constitute a breaking change — see "Maintain stable public interfaces" above. This guidance applies to documentation and examples, not code defaults.

For model *profile data* (capability flags, context windows), use the `langchain-profiles` CLI described below.

## Model profiles

Model profiles are generated using the `langchain-profiles` CLI in `libs/model-profiles`. The `--data-dir` must point to the directory containing `profile_augmentations.toml`, not the top-level package directory.

```bash
# Run from libs/model-profiles
cd libs/model-profiles

# Refresh profiles for a partner in this repo
uv run langchain-profiles refresh --provider openai --data-dir ../partners/openai/langchain_openai/data

# Refresh profiles for a partner in an external repo (requires echo y to confirm)
echo y | uv run langchain-profiles refresh --provider google --data-dir /path/to/langchain-google/libs/genai/langchain_google_genai/data
```

Example partners with profiles in this repo:

- `libs/partners/openai/langchain_openai/data/` (provider: `openai`)
- `libs/partners/anthropic/langchain_anthropic/data/` (provider: `anthropic`)
- `libs/partners/perplexity/langchain_perplexity/data/` (provider: `perplexity`)

The `echo y |` pipe is required when `--data-dir` is outside the `libs/model-profiles` working directory.

## CI/CD infrastructure

### Release process

Releases are triggered manually via `.github/workflows/_release.yml` with `working-directory` and `release-version` inputs.

### PR labeling and linting

**Title linting** (`.github/workflows/pr_lint.yml`)

**Auto-labeling:**

- `.github/workflows/pr_labeler.yml` – Unified PR labeler (size, file, title, external/internal, contributor tier)
- `.github/workflows/pr_labeler_backfill.yml` – Manual backfill of PR labels on open PRs
- `.github/workflows/auto-label-by-package.yml` – Issue labeling by package
- `.github/workflows/tag-external-issues.yml` – Issue external/internal classification

### Adding a new partner to CI

When adding a new partner package, update these files:

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml` – Add to package dropdown
- `.github/dependabot.yml` – Add dependency update entry
- `.github/scripts/pr-labeler-config.json` – Add file rule and scope-to-label mapping
- `.github/workflows/_release.yml` – Add API key secrets if needed
- `.github/workflows/auto-label-by-package.yml` – Add package label
- `.github/workflows/check_diffs.yml` – Add to change detection
- `.github/workflows/integration_tests.yml` – Add integration test config
- `.github/workflows/pr_lint.yml` – Add to allowed scopes

## GitHub Actions & Workflows

This repository require actions to be pinned to a full-length commit SHA. Attempting to use a tag will fail. Use the `gh` cli to query. Verify tags are not annotated tag objects (which would need dereferencing).

## Additional resources

- **Documentation:** https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview and source at https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs or `../docs/`. Prefer the local install and use file search tools for best results. If needed, use the docs MCP server as defined in `.mcp.json` for programmatic access.
